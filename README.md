## What does Pinterest Scraper do?
Our free Pinterest Scraper allows you to extract "pins" along with a user's profile. 

This unofficial Pinterest API is designed to give you more details than you can see in the web interface. It also enables anyone to extract public data from Pinterest without limits.

The Pinterest data scraper supports the following features:

- Scrape profiles - get metadata from the profile
- Scrape pins with full details - different kinds of pins will be parsed accordingly

## How to use Pinterest Scraper
For a step-by-step guide on how to use Pinterest Scraper, read [How to scrape data on Pinterest in 5 easy steps](https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-data-on-pinterest-in-5-easy-steps/), or watch our [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WDCpA3iR0) on YouTube.

## How much does Pinterest Scraper cost?
It will cost you approx. USD 0.25 to scrape 1,000 pins. The more results you want to scrape, the more time it will take and the more usage credits it will cost.

Apify provides you with USD 5 free usage credits to use every month on the Apify Free plan so you can get up to 20,000 pins from Pinterest Scraper for those credits. So 20,000 results will be completely free!

But if you need to get more data or to get your data regularly you should grab an Apify subscription. We recommend our $49/month Personal plan - you could get up to 200,000 Pinterest pins reviews every month with the $49 monthly plan! 

## Why scrape Pinterest?
Automatically gather data from this image sharing and social media service designed to enable the saving and discovery of images, animated GIFs, and videos.

So what can you do with that data? Here are some ideas:
- Collect data about your audience. How many subscribers do they have on average? Are they active on Pinterest? What sites do they have?
- Find the best subscribers. Make a shortlist of your ideal subscribers and actively pursue them by sending them DMs and offering partnerships!
- Collect data about your competitor's audience.

## Settings and proxies
### Profile names and URLs
You need to provide a list of profile names or Pinterest URLs (they can be mixed in any order).

### Using proxies
Pinterest now allows access under any type of proxies.

### Custom proxies
You can also use proxies from other providers in the custom proxies fields (`proxyURLs` in the JSON settings).

## Is it legal to scrape Pinterest?
Web scraping is legal, but you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. Personal data is protected by GDPR in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers.
